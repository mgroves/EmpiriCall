# Why?

There is a gap between business analytics and code analytics. Business analytics are focused on what the user is doing, classifying the user, helping the user find relevant content, etc. Code analytics are focused on the developer, helping the developer find code that needs refactoring, that isn't performant enough, etc.

These are both great. However, I think there also needs to be some analytics that are valuable to both the business people and the technical people (e.g. between Analyst/Sales & the Product Team).

I created EmpiriCall to answer questions like:

* Which features are never being used?
* Which features are used the least?
* What features does a customer use the most/least?
* How many different users use a feature?

If we know the answers to these questions, then we can use it to make decisions like:

* Can we drop a feature?
* How can we price/package features?
* Where can we focus our coding efforts to have the most impact on actual customers?
* What do our customers actually do with our software?

I know that EmpiriCall can't be the first tool to try and answer these questions and inform these decision, but I believe it approaches the problem in a way that combines the technical knowledge of the developers and the business knowledge of the sales/analyst. The result is: empyrical evidence.
